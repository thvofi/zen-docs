title: Web Panel (deprecated)
---

<Callout type="warn" title="Important Notice">
	Since the release of version [1.11b](https://zen-browser.app/release-notes/#1.11b), **Web Panel** has been indefinitely **removed** from Zen due to a discovered [security vulnerability](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1935985) that could allow websites in web panels to bypass sandboxing protections, potentially enabling malicious code execution on your system.
	
	We understand that this change may cause inconvenience to our current user base relying on Web Panel, and we sincerely apologize for the disruption. We do plan to bring Web Panel back in the future once we address these issues and ensure that Zen is stable and secure.

The **Zen Web Panel** brings your favorite web apps—like chats, notes, or to-do lists—right into your browser window for quick, side-by-side multitasking. Instead of switching tabs, you can keep essentials within reach, making it easy to reference or interact without losing focus on your main task.

With options to float or pin these panels alongside your browsing tabs, the Sidebar is perfect for keeping tools like messaging or music accessible. Planned upgrades will even add notification badges for real-time updates, creating a streamlined and productive workspace within Zen.
